      <p>What is the cloud? Where is the cloud? Are we in the cloud now? These are all questions you've probably 
        heard or even asked yourself. The term "cloud computing" is everywhere.</p>

      <h3>Cloud computing has two meanings</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The most common refers to running workloads remotely over the internet in a commercial provider’s data center, also known as the “public cloud” model</li>
        <li>The second meaning of cloud computing describes how it works: a virtualized pool of resources, from raw compute power to application functionality, available on demand</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cloud computing definitions for each type</h3>
      <p>The array of available cloud computing services is vast, but most fall into one of the following categories.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>SaaS (software as a service)</dt>
        <dd>This type of public cloud computing delivers applications over the internet through the browser. The most popular SaaS applications for business can be found in Google’s G Suite and Microsoft’s Office 365</dd>

        <dt>laaS (infrastructure as a service) definition</dt>
        <dd>At a basic level, IaaS public cloud providers offer storage and compute services on a pay-per-use basis</dd>

        <dt>PaaS (platform as a service) definition</dt>
        <dd>PaaS provides sets of services and workflows that specifically target developers, who can use shared tools, processes, and APIs to accelerate the development, testing, and deployment of applications.</dd>

        <dt>FaaS (functions as a service) definition</dt>
        <dd>FaaS, the cloud version of serverless computing, adds another layer of abstraction to PaaS, so that developers are completely insulated from everything in the stack below their code.</dd>

        <dt>Private cloud definition</dt>
        <dd>A private cloud downsizes the technologies used to run IaaS public clouds into software that can be deployed and operated in a customer’s data center. As with a public cloud, internal customers can provision their own virtual resources to build, test, and run applications</dd>
        
        <dt>Hybrid cloud definition</dt>
        <dd>A hybrid cloud is the integration of a private cloud with a public cloud. At its most developed, the hybrid cloud involves creating parallel environments in which applications can move easily between private and public clouds.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Benefits of cloud computing</h3>
      <p>The cloud’s main appeal is to reduce the time to market of applications that need to scale dynamically. Increasingly, however, developers are drawn to the cloud by the abundance of advanced new services that can be incorporated into applications, from machine learning to internet of things (IoT) connectivity.
        Although businesses sometimes migrate legacy applications to the cloud to reduce data center resource requirements, the real benefits accrue to new applications that take advantage of cloud services and “cloud native” attributes. The latter include microservices architecture, Linux containers to enhance application 
        portability, and container management solutions such as Kubernetes that orchestrate container-based services. Cloud-native approaches and solutions can be part of either public or private clouds and help enable highly efficient devops-style workflows.</p>
